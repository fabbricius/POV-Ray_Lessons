# POV-Ray_Lessons
Code of YouTube POV-Ray tutorials. It will be easier for you to experiment with.

This repo contains the codes shown in the YT POV-Ray tutorials I could find. There are two folders: 

[Felbrigg](#felbriggs-pov-ray-lessons) and [Joe Mercer](#joe-mercers-pov-ray-lessons)

There is also a **screenshots** folder that contains the images used
in this readme.

Both are good introductions, unfortunately they are not finished. Both
tutorials were supposed to be longer, but they stop after 7 or 8
lessons. Too bad !

In any case, I thank Felbrigg and Joe Mercer for what the lessons they
uploaded on youtube and I am grateful they did that. You have a nice
introduction to POV-Ray with them. They are many tutorials available
on internet, although not on video (and they are probably more YT
POV-Ray lessons somewhere).



### Here are some other POV-Ray resources:

* The official [POV-Ray tutorial](https://www.povray.org/documentation/3.7.0/t2_0.html)

* Friedrich A. Lohmüller [tutorial](https://www.f-lohmueller.de/index.htm), available in several languages. Friedrich is now deceased (RIP) but thanks to his wife his work did not disappear.

* Build a [Tron lightcycle in POV-Ray](https://youtu.be/AxiEZKNh_1E?si=KYf5Cmt4f5NAG5ni). This youtube lesson made by Pixelpaws 3D is very nice. The code is not included on this github repository, you can find it on the video description for a small fee. Direct link to scene [here](https://pixelpaws3d.gumroad.com/l/atbbf). Find more on his [Artstation space](https://www.artstation.com/dcmarriott).

There are probably more useful resources.


Now, the lessons:

This lesson is longer. You will create a jet engine the smart way, by repeating things.

You will go from this basic torus:

to this super cool jet engine:
