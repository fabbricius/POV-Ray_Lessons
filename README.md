# POV-Ray_Lessons
Code of YouTube POV-Ray tutorials. It will be easier for you to experiment with.

This repo contains the codes shown in the YT POV-Ray tutorials I could find. There are two folders: 

**Felbrigg** and **JoeMercer**.

There is also a **screenshots** folder that contains the images used
in this readme.

Both are good introductions, unfortunately they are not finished. Both
tutorials were supposed to be longer, but they stop after 7 or 8
lessons. They end both with "in the next lesson, we'll cover xxxx" but
there is **no** next lesson unfortunately. As far as I understand,
Felbrigg started to be paid to do a more complete course for a
learning company, and Joe Mercer simply stopped his courses.

In any case, I thank Felbrigg and Joe Mercer for what the lessons they
uploaded on youtube and I am grateful they did that. You have a nice
introduction to POV-Ray with them. They are many tutorials available
on internet, although not on video (and they are probably more YT
POV-Ray lessons somewhere).



## Here are some other POV-Ray resources:

Friedrich A. Lohmüller tutorial (available in several languages):

Friedrich is now deceased (RIP) but thanks to his wife his work did not disappear.

There are probably more useful resources.
