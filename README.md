# POV-Ray_Lessons
Code of YouTube POV-Ray tutorials. It will be easier for you to experiment with.

For French audience: lisez cette page directement en Français! (traduction par gg translate) C'est [par ici](https://github-com.translate.goog/fabbricius/POV-Ray_Lessons?_x_tr_sl=bg&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp).

This repo contains the codes shown in several POV-Ray tutorials I could find on Youtube. There are three folders: 

[Felbrigg](#felbriggs-pov-ray-lessons)

[Joe Mercer](#joe-mercers-pov-ray-lessons)

The [more_tutorials](#more-tutorials) folder contains several single-video tutorials that are availables on youtube.

[More resources](#here-are-some-other-pov-ray-resources)
There are also some resources I gathered.

There is also a **screenshots** folder that contains the images used
in this readme.

Both are good introductions, unfortunately they are not finished. Both
tutorials were supposed to be longer, but they stop after 7 or 8
lessons. Too bad !

In any case, I thank Felbrigg and Joe Mercer for what the lessons they
uploaded on youtube and I am grateful they did that. You have a nice
introduction to POV-Ray with them. They are many tutorials available
on internet, although not on video (and they are probably more YT
POV-Ray lessons somewhere).

## Joe Mercer's POV-Ray lessons

Joe Mercer POV-Ray lessons playlist can be found here: [Joe Mercer POV-Ray lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiXV4EPnTyg&list=PLlW5kivBxMYtCFiSnhlhceFsTSCeuJImm)

### Lesson 0: installing POV-Ray on Windows
[Lesson 0 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/YiXV4EPnTyg?si=7JCwjYlBefsdD_4e) how to install POV-Ray on Windows (the installer can be found on [www.povray.org](https://www.povray.org/))

There is no code on this lesson.


### Lesson 1: balls (it's start, right ?)
[Lesson 1 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/1ZDWcEQrqsc?si=FIgKVPUI63EIWVwX) Getting started. You will create balls and learn about colors.

Here is what you will create:
![balls](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson1_screen1.png)

Nice start, isn't it?

The code can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson1).


### Lesson 2: transformations
[Lesson 2 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/h4y0aami5XI?si=UKPCwsAuoedaozfN) 

You will learn about transformation: scale, rotate, translate, and also about "sky sphere" gradient.
It is used to create a realistic sky. 

![deformed ball](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson2_screen1.png)

The code can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson2).


### Lesson 3: cylinder, box, cone, torus
[Lesson 3 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/qOcMhwmoWC8?si=HUv0ukbkz4BXbsQX)

You will learn about basic objects used to create things.

![red torus and green cone](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson3_screen1.png)

The code can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson3). Some parts are commented, using the standard C-style comment sign. You can remove the comments as you experiment with the code by watching the video at the same time.


### Lesson 4: rotations, color maps, image maps
[Lesson 4 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/rMg5qtROb8M?si=zaYWkO9dFDobrEmf)

You will learn a lot in this lesson: rotation, color maps, and how to map a color gradient or an image on a surface, which is very useful!

Box rotated:
![box rotated](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson4_screen1.png)

Gradients mapped on a box:
![box with color gradient](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson4_screen2.png)

Gradient with 3 colors:
![box with 3-colors gradient](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson4_screen3.png)


The code can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson4). Some parts are commented, using the standard C-style comment sign. You can remove the comments as you experiment with the code by watching the video at the same time. The folder also contains the image which will mapped on the box. You can use it directly.
There are also the code for the grids that are used at the begining of the lesson.

Final screenshot:
![box with an image mapped on it](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson4_screen4.png)



### Lesson 5: placing image maps on curved objects
[Lesson 5 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/KlVpVEBvp-g?si=X0nzZRVa-7wM7XTh)

In this lesson you will learn about image mapping. There are severla type of mapping, and each of them are adapted to what you want to map them on.

Image mapped on a box:
![grid with image on box](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson5_screen1.png)

The same image mapped on a cylinder:
![grid with image on cylinder](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson5_screen2.png)


The code can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson5). The images used in the messon are there, too. I did a screenshot on youtube as fullscreen and modified the resolution to match what Joe was using. Everything is ready to compile.
There are also the code for the images presented by Joe to explain the different types of mapping and how they must be used on curved objects. Among them is the landscape that Joe maps on the cylinder, and also the world map.

Understanding the type of maps:
![Two kinds of image maps](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson5_screen3.png)

Mapping a landscape on a cylinder:
![landscape mapped](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson5_screen4.png)

Mapping an image on a box, a cylinder and a thiner cylinder:
![several kind of mapping](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson5_screen5.png)

World Map, mapped on a sphere:
![map on sphere](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson5_screen6.png)


### Lesson 6: S.O.R. (Surface of revolution)

In this lesson, you will learn a new way of creating curved objects: by entering coordinates of points that will be linked one to the other in order to create a nice curve. 

[Lesson 6 on Youtube](https://youtu.be/QKqO5V8FYPU?si=xrziI8zA5kuL9Ek-)

Look at the nice pot you will create:
![red pot](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson6_screen1.png)

This pot is constructed by the means of SOR (Surface of Revolution): points are entered, then the line obtained is rotated around an axis. The pot above is created this way:

![pot in 2D](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson6_screen2.png)

Then the pot will be "digged":
![pot digged](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson6_screen3.png)

Then an image will be mapped on the pot to obtain the final pot:

![pot with image](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson6_screen4.png)

The code for this essential lesson can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson6)


### Lesson 7: sphere sweeps, spline, unions
[Lesson 7 on Youtube](

In this lesson you will learn about sweeps. 

First sphere moves to another position with a linear spline:
![blah blah](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen1.png)

The same with four points, but still on a linear spline. You get a baseball bat:
![blah blah](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen2.png)

And now you use a cubic spline:
![blah blah](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen3.png)

The 'b' spline [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) is similar. Joe compares the 3 types of splines in sub-lesson c (in my repo it's file JoeMercerLesson7c.pov):

![comparing splines](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen4.png)
From top to bottom:
- Bézier spline (nice smooth transition)
- cubic spline
- linear spline

With five points (sub-lessons d and e):

![5 points](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen5.png)

By improving the spline (Bézier), you get this:

![nice handle](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen6.png)

Comparing splines:

![comparing splines 2](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen7.png)

From left to right:
- linear spline
- cubic spline
- linear spline


The rest of the lesson uses what was learned before to build a coffee cup that is drawn here in 2D:

![coffee cup plan](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen8.png)

After coding this into POV-Ray (look for files JoeMercerLesson7Cup files):

![coffee cup](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen9.png)

Then Joe will it more thickness:
![coffee cup 2](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen10.png)

Then an image will be mapped to it. The final coffee cup is shown here:

![final coffee cup](screenshots/JoeMercer_lesson7_screen11.png)

The code can be found [here](JoeMercer/lesson7). 

This is the last lesson. In the (non-existing) next lesson, Joe was going to talk about triangles and polygon. Too bad he stopped his super tutorial. Thanks to him anyway for the first lessons, they are great.


## More tutorials 1: Josie's cup

How to create a cup in POV-Ray (lesson in spanish): [Cómo crear una COPA en POV-RAY](https://youtu.be/IJnfv8B5lFw?si=JswceNnbBRgLVLyj)
In this short lesson you will create a glass of wine. It's in spanish but you can translate it into any language (I've watched it with french subtitles).
The code can be found in the ![tuto_josie.pov](more_tutorials/tuto_josie.pov) file, in the [more_tutorials folder](more_tutorials).
Here is what you will obtain: ![ball](screenshots/Josie_M_screen1.png)

## More tutorials 2: Geometric Shapes
Render Geometric Shapes on a Realistic Environment: [Render Geometric Shapes](https://youtu.be/TaX6rF4BvjY)
You will create many stuff in this lesson. There are very few explaination, but what's nice in POV-Ray is that you can just look at the code to see how it's made!
The code can be found in the ![makta_project.pov](more_tutorials/makta_project.pov) file, in the [more_tutorials folder](more_tutorials). There is also a small gif file, makta_map.gif![makta_map.gif](more_tutorials/makta_map.gif), which is used as an image *mapped* onto a sphere (sunglasses with a nose and a smile). This file differs a bit from the one used in the video, but I had to do this as the original file is not given.
Here is what you will get: ![shapes](screenshots/makta_project_thumbnail.png)


## Here are some other POV-Ray resources:

* The official [POV-Ray tutorial](https://www.povray.org/documentation/)
This is the official documentation from the POV-Ray site. A bit hard if you start, in my opinion.

* Friedrich A. Lohmüller [tutorial](https://www.f-lohmueller.de/index.htm), available in several languages. Friedrich is now deceased (RIP) but thanks to his wife his work did not disappear. Great documentation!
![f-lohmueller](screenshots/flohmueller_site.png)

* a PDF file "A short introduction to POV-Ray" from a german university. file availaible [here](https://sus.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/Lehre/SS_Tools/POVRAY/POVRAY_PeterFischer.pdf)

* a PDF file from an american university: [AM 205 POV-Ray tutorial](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~chr/am205/g_act/am205_povray.pdf).

* 25 POV-Ray scenes, with the code and screenshots. It's [here on github](https://github.com/susam/pov25).
One example: ![25_scenes](screenshots/25_scenes.png)

* Build a [Tron lightcycle in POV-Ray](https://youtu.be/AxiEZKNh_1E?si=KYf5Cmt4f5NAG5ni). This youtube lesson made by Pixelpaws 3D is very nice. The code is not included on this github repository, you can find it on the video description for a small fee. Direct link to scene [here](https://pixelpaws3d.gumroad.com/l/atbbf). Find more on his [Artstation space](https://www.artstation.com/dcmarriott).
